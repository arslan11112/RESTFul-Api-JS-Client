# MVC Movie Catalogue web application

 MVC (Model, Controller, View) web application that uses multiple Java servlets and JSP views to allow the user to have full CRUD functionality on the film DB.  

 The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern separates an application's concerns into three main components, maintaining layers with defined functions: 
* The model, which process the application data  and represents the business logic;
* The view, which displays the data to the user;
* The controller, which handles user input and interactions and updates the model and view accordingly.
  
By breaking down the functionality of the application in this way, it allows for a clear and organized structure that is easy to understand and customize.
