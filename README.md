# RESTFul-Api-JS-Client
Main purpose: Developing, deploying and consuming web services. 

Developed a RESTful web service that provides a communication interface with a film database. It uses HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on the film database.

The web service is consumed by a JavaScript client, which is a program that runs in a web browser and is written in JavaScript language. The client interacts with the web service by sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP responses. The client can perform operations on the film database, such as retrieving a list of films, adding a new film, updating information about a film, and deleting a film.
